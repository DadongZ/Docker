#what happens in 'docker container run'
1. look for that image locally in image cache, doesn't find anything
2. Looks in remote image repository (default to Docker Hub)
3. Downloads the latest version (nginx: latest by default)
4. create new container based on that image and prepares to start
5. Gives it a virtual IP on a private network
6. opens up port 80 on host and forwards to port 80 in container
7. Starts container by using the CMD in the image Dockerfile

docker container run --publish 8080:80 \ #change host listening port to 8080
                     --name webhost \
                     -d nginx:1.11 \ #version
                     nginx -T #change CMD run on start
